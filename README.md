**SIMPLE SHELL**

The main aim of this project is to write a simple UNIX shell.
The whole project was made possible by both **archdaisy[[https://github.com/achdaisy]] & Mk-0-wan[[https://github.com/Mk-0-wan]]**
Here is a list of system calls commands we have so far used.
***
    1. execvp() - executing shell commands passed to it
    2. strtok() - tokenizing string of chars passed on the shell prompt
    3. wait() - system call which waits for the child process to finish first before returning to the parent process.
    4. fork() - used to make new processes.

Will keep on updating the list as we add more and more mods to it.
Our simple shell currently will be able to handle some the system or builtin commands like of `ls` small and basic stuff.
